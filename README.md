# How to start working with the collection in Postman for API testing purpose  

To begin using the code from github you need to create `Team Workspace` for your Postman account (if not created): [Create a new workspace in Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/#create-a-new-workspace).
Otherwise you won't be able to connect GitHub from Postman.

## 1. Postman

1. Log in to Postman
2. On the left sidebar click on `APIs` icon
```
   Note: if there is no 'APIs' icon - click on the last icon `Configure workspase sidebar` and turn on `APIs` element toggle
```
3. Create a new API, name it
```
   Note: for free Postman version there is possibility to have only one connected repository.
   If you have previously created API - you need to delete it or disconnect repository
   To disconnect repository:
- click on created API
- click on `Source control` icon on the right sidebar
- click on three dots
- click on `Disconnect repository` - the collection will be deleted from previously created API
```
